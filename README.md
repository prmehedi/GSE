Aims and objectives of the study 
The aim of the study is comparative analysis of microarray datasets of Alzheimer’s & Huntington’s disease to identify genes that are differentially expressed in Alzheimer’s disease distinct from Huntington’s disorders. 
To identify differentially expressed genes(DEGs) in AD and HD.
To identify the DEGs common to both  AD and HD.
To identify the  DEGs unique  to AD.
To Evaluate the biological processes, molecular function, cellular component.
